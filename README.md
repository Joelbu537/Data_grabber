> I am working on it, but have no idea on what to do:)
> So unless you have admin permissions on the target machine, you can't remote execute commands!
1. Execute the background.exe on the target device (Its going to start the actual grabber)
2. Check your Discord Webhook, you should see a message containing lots of informations!
3. Use TCP Message Sender and connect to the IP:PORT from the webhook.
